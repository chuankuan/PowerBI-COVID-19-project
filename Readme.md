### Brief descrition:
### This project is created during my SGUnited Skillfuture proegram for Associate Data Anaylst on June-2021.
### Title: Rise and fall of COVID-19 in Germany
### This Power BI project shows the number of COVID-19 daily cases in Germany based on data from the above Kaggle website.
### Through observation, the website updates the latest information every 2 days. For my project, the date of the dataset date range between January-2020 and June-2021.
### I created 4 slides of dashboard.
### First dahboard shows the demographics as introduction of population of Germany with the country's map by adding each and every states' longitude and latitude. Bubbles are added on each state to indicate the population size in each state.
### On second dashboard, a same Germany map is created, but this time, it shows the number of death cases in each state. I also do a time lapse on daily basis using play axis visualisation on the daily death cases. A bar chart with age group is also plotted to show majority of COVID=19 cases falls on the elderly group.
### Third dashboard shows the number of death cases bar chart through time to tell when did the first wave, second wave and third wave of COVID-19 have occured and their severity in number of death count. Another bar chart is plotted also with time but with age group separated by colours.
### 4th dahboard show the vacinnation progress which started on January-2021 up to June-0221. A line chart shows which brand of 3 vaccines are taken by the people.
### 2 waterfall charts shows the progress of first dose of vaccination by month and another shows the second chart shows the progress of 2nd vaccination by month for comparison between them. As the vaccination started in January-2021, the 3rd wave did not exploded compared to the first and second wave back in year 2020. This can be shown on line chart of the total daily death cases.
